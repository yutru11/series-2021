   Markdown specifically is a family of syntaxes that are based on the
   original work of John Gruber with substantial contributions from
   Aaron Swartz, released in 2004 [MARKDOWN].  Since its release, a
   number of web or web-facing applications have incorporated Markdown
   into their text-entry systems, frequently with custom extensions.
   Fed up with the complexity and security pitfalls of formal markup
   languages (e.g., HTML5) and proprietary binary formats (e.g.,
   commercial word-processing software), yet unwilling to be confined to
   the restrictions of plain text, many users have turned to Markdown
   for document processing.  Whole toolchains now exist to support
   Markdown for online and offline projects.
