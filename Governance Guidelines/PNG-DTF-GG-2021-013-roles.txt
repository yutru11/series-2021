# Roles

## INTRODUCTION
This document describes the initial proposed rights and responsibilities of the "internal" roles of the YuTru scheme.

## SCHEME ROLES (INTERNAL)
We offer this note to Dentons to help draft an "agreement" or "contract" to bind members to these roles in the scheme during the course of their registration.
We need the agreeemnt to be legally valid in the legal jurisdiction of PNG with an eye to the broader Asia-Pacific context.
We offer some initial key concepts and definitions to help us explain the structure we are seeking.
We wish to support the use of Internet Standards in PNG and what are referred to therein as Best Current Practices (BCP) because these are non-proprietary and are free to access and use, with some provisions for crediting authors of important original work.
We start here using the words: 'must' and 'may', to define requirement levels, as defined in RFC2119 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). At this initial stage we have not used the full vocabulary.

### Differences between Scheme Roles (Internal and External)
Internal roles are those that *govern the scheme*, and include: ordinary members, participating members, and foundation members (aka 'foundation shareholders' or the scheme owners).

External roles are those that *are governed by the scheme*, and although they are not the subject of this note, external roles include: 
	the trust framework operator, 
	end users, and 
	participating entities which are one or more of either: 
			credential providers, 
			attribute providers, or 
			relying parties.

### Internal Roles Organise to Form the Governance Organs
Those occupying internal roles (to be described next - i.e. orindary, particpating, and foundation) may be voted into the various governance organs of the trust framework operator.

Those occupying internal roles and serving in governance organs, say sitting on the "Governance Council", will do so for time-bound periods.
The governance organs - conceptually and operationally - do the work of the trust framework operator to govern over the YuTru identity ecosystem.
The governance organs provide a way of segregating duties so that one cannot unduly affect or capture another, in the cases those situations may arise and cause the scheme's integrity to be jeopardised.
Internal organs include: the governance council, the scheme commissioner, the board of directors, and subcommittees.
Subcommittees are either: discussion groups, project groups, or working groups. 


### Joining the Scheme, Noted Common to All Registrants
+ All registrants *must* sign an attendance sheet at each subcommittee meeting.
+ All registrants must pay a scheme subscription fee each year to be specified in a schedule.
+ All registrants Must pay a once-off joining fee to establish them in the scheme.
+ Subcommitttee meetings will be video-minuted.
+ If scheme registration lapses for more than 90 days, the registration fee will need to be paid again.
+ The instrument will designate one of three levels for the legal or natural person to sign-up at: participants, members, or foundation shareholders.  
+ Each of the levels will bestow different but increasing rights and responsibilities the higher up they are.
+ The register to be kept by the DIBL will not be secret. The register will say who has signed up and at wht level they have signed up at.
+ Each registrant must state the name of a natural person, and maybe more than one on a roster, as being valid delegates.
+ The scheme needs to be completely transparent in how it governs, by memoralising its governance rules in the "governance guidelines" (to be written). 
+ Joining the scheme should happen for periods of no less than two years at a time. This is to allow for defining the rules in one year and then implementing them in the next. 
+ Effectively a rolling window of these two functions: define and implement (applied to either scheme rules or governance guidelines or both).
+ Each year, if the rules are updated will be designated by the "series" moniker, followed by the year, e.g. Governance Guidelines (Series 2021) or Scheme Rules (Series 2021).
